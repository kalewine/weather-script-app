# weather-script-app
##A simple weather app for the command line
###Background:
I built this script as a learning excercise during my Develop Carolina appreticeship. 
The instructions for this assignment can be found here: [Engineerkit](https://link-url-here.org)
I used the [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) api.
###Instructions:
1. To run this script, you'll need to register for an API key via [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). 
2. Configure your environment variable in your terminal. Do so by running $export KEY="your api key".
3. Run the script by typing "bash weather.sh" in the terminal. 
Note: To be fancy, set up an alias: alias weather="bash weather.sh" and then the command "weather" will run the script.
4. The instructions on the screen will ask you to type in a zipcode. Do so and press enter. 

###What's Next: 
Possible extensions include enabling dynamic locales or generating additional information based upon the weather conditions. For example, if it's raining, produce the message "Don't forget your umbrella!"
